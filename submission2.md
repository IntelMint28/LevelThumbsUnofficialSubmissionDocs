# Submission Instructions (Post-Linking)
> If your account isn't linked, refer to the resources to help linking your account to level thumbnails.

Now that your Discord account is linked to your Geometry Dash account, all that linked to Level Thumbs, we can move on how to actually upload a thumbnail.

## How do I submit a thumbnail?
The system has become an in-game process, so now you must do it within Geometry Dash rather than within the Discord Server.

First, you'll want to enable this option in the settings for Level Thumbnails, which you can find through the Geode menu:

Then, enter a level and open the pause menu. You will see this button that's circled in the top right:

Play through a decent bit of the level, then once you reach a part that you feel is good, click the button to take a screenshot! Then you can click the "Submit" button.
