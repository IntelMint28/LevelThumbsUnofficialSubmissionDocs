# Thumbnail Submission Instructions
The submission instructions are in the Discord Server, but here is a twist - you need to do a bit stuff before uploading your thumbnails.

To authorize your Discord & your Geometry Dash account, you must do the following steps:

## 1. Sign up with your Discord account
**1.1.** Go to **[the official level thumbnails website](https://levelthumbs.prevter.me)**.

**1.2.** You should see something similar like this. Click/tap on the ***Sign in*** button.
