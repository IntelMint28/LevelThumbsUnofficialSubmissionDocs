# Thumbnail Submission Instructions
The submission instructions are in the Discord Server, but *here is a twist* - you need to do a bit stuff before uploading your thumbnails.

To authorize your Discord & your Geometry Dash account, you must do the following steps:

## 1. Sign up with your Discord account
**1.1.** Go to **[the official level thumbnails website](https://levelthumbs.prevter.me)**.

**1.2.** You should see something similar like this. Click/Tap on the ***Sign in*** button and authorize the website to your Discord account.

You will get inside the dashboard.

**1.3.** Navigate to the settings section of the dashboard and do the requested instructions given. Here is a little resume of what you need to do:

  **a)** Click/Tap the Link Account button. This will copy a secret token to your clipboard. DO NOT SHARE YOUR SECRET TOKEN WITH ANYBODY!!
  
  **b)** Open to Geometry Dash and go to the settings for the Level Thumbnails mod.
  
  **c)** Scroll all the way to the bottom until you see the 'Link Account' setting all the way to the botton and paste your secret token to the text box.

  **d)** Click the Link button. Take in mind this is irreversible and your geometry dash account will be linked to the mod forever.

  > Also, renember setting your Thumbnails API URL to the default one (levelthumbs.prevter.me). If you try to do it with another url, such as Anarchy Thumbnails, the linking will eventually fail.
