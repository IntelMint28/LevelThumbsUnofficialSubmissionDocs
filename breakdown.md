# Breakdown
Level Thumbnails is a featured Geometry Dash mod that can be installed on the Geode Mod Loader. It lets you have thumbnails on levels (pretty obvious, isn't it?)
All the thumbnails are human-made and they are created with an in-game submission system. There used to be a submission system based on their discord server, but the submissions channel is currently archived and that method is currently **deprecated**.

For the thumbnails there are several restrictions, that guarantees thumbnails for actual relevant levels. Here is some of the rules you should follow up (you can find the full rules before submitting a thumbnail):

### Do not upload thumbnails to any random level
This means you should not upload thumbnails for recent tab levels (at least recent tab levels without filters). Thumbnail Moderators last time checking thumbnails, and you uploading a thumbnail for a little timmy level is just a waste of time for them.

### Find a relevant part of the level
You should place up a part of the level that looks fun or the most iconical one, since uploading thumbnails on the first 10 percent of the level is just a disgrace to Thumbnail Moderators.
