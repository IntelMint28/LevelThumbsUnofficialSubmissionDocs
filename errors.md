# Error explanation
I know, you may stumbled across an error when uploading your thumbnail, but that is no worries here! In this section of the documentation i will explain the errors that can show up, and what to do.

## Thumbnail upload failed: auth error
<img width="608" height="272" alt="autherror" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0dfc8b6-7fea-4f19-9f3d-2d8fe00d3d27" />

This means, the mod failed to authorize you into the server to upload the thumbnail.

### What causes it
This error popping up has one or more of these situations:

***1. You didn't Log In***

Basically you didn't Link the mod with your Geometry Dash account. Consider checking the **[submission Instructions](https://github.com/IntelMint28/LevelThumbsUnofficialSubmissionDocs/blob/main/submission.md)** to fix your issue.

***2. server API is DOWN***

What this means is that the [prevter](https://prevter.me)'s Level Thumbnails server went down, so you will need to wait for it to fix. You can always check is the API is up in the **#updates** channel of the Discord Server.

***3. the API URL is not the default***

In a short term, your API URL on the Level Thumbnails Mod Settings is not [https://levelthumbs.prevter.me](https://levelthumbs.prevter.me). To fix this issue, its just as simple as going to the mod's settings and changing the Thumbnails API URL to default (there is a button for it). 

***4. Level Thumbnails API is going SLOW.***

Not all servers are good, so expect Level Thumbnails to jump up the Auth Error when its going extremely slow.

## Thumbnail upload failed: Thumbnail submissions are temporalily disabled

It's pretty obvious. The administators taken down the submissions. **Verified Thumbnailers** CAN bypass this, since they thumbnails dont pass through a moderator, unless a thumbnail will be replaced. But if you are a **Verified Thumbnailer** and you can't upload thumbnails, or you are a common person trying to upload thumbnails, read the following:

### How to fix the issue

***1. If you are a normal person, you literally can't do anything.***

The moderators request very gently to the normal people to wait to the submissions to be up again.

***2. But if you are a Verified Thumbnailer...***

If you are a **Verified Thumbnailer** and you still can't upload thumbnails, it means [prevter](https://prevter.me) still didn't add you to his database.

To fix the issue, you may request [prevter](https://prevter.me) to add you to his database as a Verified Thumbnailer, this way skipping the error entirely.

If you are ***NOT*** a **Verified Thumbnailer**, do not even try to do the thing above.

## Thumbnail upload failed: User not found

I sadly do not know what this error can mean on any context. If you encounter this error, contact one of the mod developers.
